# CODSOFT Projects Repository

Welcome to the CODSOFT Projects Repository! This repository showcases the projects I completed during my internship at CODSOFT, demonstrating my skills in web development. Explore the projects below:

**To-Do List**

**Description:** Create a simple to-do list application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Users can add tasks, mark them as completed, and delete them. The application provides a user-friendly interface for efficient task management.

**Personal Portfolio Website**

**Description:** Develop a personal portfolio website to showcase skills, projects, and contact information. This website serves as an online resume, allowing visitors to learn about background, view projects, and get in touch. It incorporates responsive design and smooth navigation for optimal user experience.

**Digital Clock**
**Description:** Build a digital clock that displays the current time in hours, minutes, and seconds. This real-time clock updates automatically to show the accurate time. The clock's layout is designed using HTML and CSS, while JavaScript dynamically obtains and updates the time.

**Real-Time Chat Application**

**Description:** Develop a real-time chat application enabling users to exchange messages instantly. Features include chat rooms, user authentication, and multimedia support. HTML and CSS create the chat interface, while JavaScript, along with technologies like WebSocket (e.g., Socket.io), facilitates real-time messaging.

**E-commerce Website**
**Description:** Create a medium-sized e-commerce website where users can browse products, add to cart, and complete purchases. Features include product listings, shopping cart functionality, user accounts, and checkout process. JavaScript handles client-side interactions, while a back-end server (e.g., Node.js) manages user data, products, and payments.
