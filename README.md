# CODSOFT Projects Repository

Welcome to the CODSOFT Projects Repository! This repository showcases the projects I completed during my internship at CODSOFT, demonstrating my skills in web development. Explore the projects below:

**1.To-Do List**

**Description:** Create a simple to-do list application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Users can add tasks, mark them as completed, and delete them. The application provides a user-friendly interface for efficient task management.


**2.Personal Portfolio Website**

**Description:** Develop a personal portfolio website to showcase skills, projects, and contact information. This website serves as an online resume, allowing visitors to learn about background, view projects, and get in touch. It incorporates responsive design and smooth navigation for optimal user experience.


**3.Digital Clock**

**Description:** Build a digital clock that displays the current time in hours, minutes, and seconds. This real-time clock updates automatically to show the accurate time. The clock's layout is designed using HTML and CSS, while JavaScript dynamically obtains and updates the time.
